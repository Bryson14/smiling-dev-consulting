title: Choosing Intentional Media Over Doom Scrolling
description: Being intentional about the sources of media, articles,
  entertainment with my time has been helping me reflect on the current state of
  technology and social media apps. I'm wary of the amount of time I use it and
  the image that I present to kids.

Its a weird world we live in. I can know about everything that is happening in the world and yet I feel like I trust so little. I'm sure it is happening to everyone. I see podcasts, video shorts, long form videos, coworker conversations all pointing to that we are getting so much information but we hold on to so little.

I get this scenario a lot. I get a text message from a family member asking if I have seen the Instagram video they sent me. I haven't. I'm intentionally kid of avoiding it. I then see a notification pop up that another family member has sent me a Facebook video over Messager. I get home from work, and I now have 20+ notifications of Instagram videos, reddit threads, x word-fights, and Facebook garbage on my phone. I'm tired just thinking of it.  
  
So what should I do? I've considered for a few minutes getting a flip phone, but i need email and most regular apps for banking.
