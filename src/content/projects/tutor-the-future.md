## Project Overview

Tutor the Future represents my most comprehensive full-stack development projectâ€”a complete tutoring management platform that has evolved from a local service website into a scalable educational technology solution. This ongoing partnership spans over two years and demonstrates the power of iterative development and strategic platform evolution.

## The Journey

**Phase 1: Foundation (themassapequatutor.com)**
The project began as a local tutoring service website that quickly revealed the need for more sophisticated management capabilities. As the business grew, manual processes became unsustainable, prompting the development of a custom platform.

**Phase 2: Platform Evolution (tutorthefuture.com)**
After two years of collaboration and understanding the business requirements, we rebuilt and rebranded the platform as a comprehensive tutoring management system designed for scale and expansion.

## Technical Architecture

I designed and implemented a modern, cloud-native platform using cutting-edge technologies:

**Frontend Stack**
- **React & TypeScript**: Type-safe, component-based user interface
- **Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui**: Modern, responsive design system
- **TanStack Router**: Advanced client-side routing and navigation
- **Real-time updates**: Live scheduling and notification systems

**Backend Infrastructure**
- **AWS Amplify**: Full-stack development platform providing authentication, APIs, and hosting
- **GraphQL API**: Efficient data fetching and real-time subscriptions
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for scalable business logic
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database optimized for performance and scale
- **AWS S3**: Secure file storage for documents and media
- **API Gateway**: Managed API endpoints with built-in security

**Payment Processing**
- **Legacy integration**: Original PayPal implementation
- **Modern solution**: Migration to Stripe for enhanced payment capabilities
- **Secure transactions**: PCI-compliant payment processing
