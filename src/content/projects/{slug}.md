## Project Overview

FFO Officers needed a sophisticated digital presence to match their expertise in providing fractional CFO services to scaling businesses. With New York clients and ambitious growth plans, they required a professional website that would establish credibility and generate qualified leads within an aggressive two-week timeline.
