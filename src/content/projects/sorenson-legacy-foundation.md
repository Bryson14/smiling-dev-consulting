## Project Overview

I helped the Sorenson Legacy Foundation modernize their outdated website by migrating from a decade-old WordPress installation to a modern, cost-effective platform. This comprehensive website overhaul addressed both technical and financial challenges while improving the user experience.

## The Challenge

The foundation's website had been running on the same WordPress setup for over 10 years without updates. This created several problems:

- **High hosting costs**: The organization was paying hundreds of dollars monthly for cloud hosting that had been set up and forgotten by a previous developer
- **Outdated technology**: The aging WordPress installation posed security risks and performance issues
- **Poor user experience**: Slow loading times, outdated design, and suboptimal mobile responsiveness
- **Limited content management**: Staff struggled to make updates using the complex, outdated system

## My Solution

I executed a complete platform migration that transformed both the technical foundation and user experience:

**Cost Optimization**
- Migrated all content and functionality from WordPress to Wix
- Eliminated expensive cloud hosting fees, reducing monthly costs by hundreds of dollars
- Set up a sustainable, budget-friendly hosting solution

**Performance Improvements**
- Optimized all images for faster loading times and better user experience
- Improved website speed and mobile responsiveness
- Enhanced SEO keywords and search engine visibility

**Design & Usability**
- Modernized the visual design with improved layouts and spacing
- Enhanced readability and navigation across all pages
- Ensured consistent branding throughout the site

**Future-Proofing**
- Provided the foundation with an intuitive content management system
- Enabled staff to easily make updates and add content without technical expertise
- Established a reliable, mainstream platform for long-term sustainability

## Results

The migration delivered immediate and ongoing benefits:

- **Significant cost savings**: Eliminated hundreds in monthly hosting fees
- **Improved performance**: Faster loading times and better user experience
- **Enhanced accessibility**: Staff can now manage content independently
- **Better online presence**: Improved SEO and professional appearance
- **Reduced technical debt**: Modern, secure platform with regular updates

This project demonstrates how strategic technology decisions can simultaneously reduce costs, improve user experience, and empower organizations to manage their digital presence more effectively.
