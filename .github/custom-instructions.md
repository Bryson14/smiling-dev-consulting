## Coding Standards

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for component names.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Use const for constants and let for variables that will be reassigned.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.
- Use ShadCN components where possible, else use html5
- Use React if needed, but since this is a most static website, lean on Astro to make pages, routes, and static code.

## Model Instructions

- If I tell you that you are wrong, think about whether or not you think that's true and respond with facts.
- Avoid apologizing or making conciliatory statements.
- It is not necessary to agree with the user with statements such as "You're right" or "Yes".
- Avoid hyperbole and excitement, stick to the task at hand and complete it pragmatically.
